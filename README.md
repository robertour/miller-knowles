# miller-knowles implementations

This an implementation of [Miller and Knowles simulation](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/ecal2015/ch026.html), that also contains attritions of the fittest nodes.

This implementation relies on [Networkx](https://networkx.github.io/) and important optimizations have been done for the simulations to run fast.

Many thanks to Steve Miller who facilitated his original code and his constant help in replicating his results.
